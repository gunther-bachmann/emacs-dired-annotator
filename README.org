#+title: dired-annotator

Keep notes to files in dired.

* General ideas

  This package will either use hashes or absolute file names to associate org notes with regular files. Whereas hashes will enable to
  identify files that may have been moved but did not change, the absolute file name will identify files that changed but did not move.

  When adding a note to a file, the identification method (hash or absolute file name) is selected. Currently there is no way to change this
  easily afterwards.

  All notes are kept as org files within a single folder.

  It is integrated with dired. Files that have associated note files will be annotated in dired (e.g. with a document symbol). This can be
  switched on and off. The note can be viewed (e.g. with a posframe) opening the note.

  Since getting the hash of folders with a large number of files takes some time, default is that nothing is displayed. Switching it on, all
  file hashes are computed and each file is checked whether a note is available for that file. Those files with associated note files will
  be marked with the configured icon.

  It also is integrated with ~dired-subtree~ ([[https://github.com/Fuco1/dired-hacks][repo]]). When unfolding trees while notes should be displayed, all additional files displayed will
  be checked. Folding will then remove those icons alongside the subtree.

  The integration with ~dired-sidebar~ ([[https://github.com/jojojames/dired-sidebar][repo]]) is somewhat limited, since tracking changes in the sidebar will toggle reruns of the hashing of
  the whole folder (and open subfolders) which might take a while. This cannot be prevented at the moment.

* Installation

  Since this currently is no package available on gnu, non-gnu nor melpa, clone the repository
  #+begin_src sh
    git clone https://github.com/gunther-bachmann/emacs-dired-annotator
  #+end_src

  and add this to your init file. Please adjust the load-path to the folder into which the project was cloned.
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package dired-annotator
      :load-path "~/repo/emacs-dired-annotator"
      :bind (:map dired-mode-map
                  ("C-c a s" . #'dired-annotator-show-icons)
                  ("C-c a h" . #'dired-annotator-hide-icons)
                  ("C-c a k" . #'dired-annotator-delete-note)
                  ("C-c a o" . #'dired-annotator-edit-note)
                  ("C-c a e" . #'dired-annotator-edit-note)
                  ("C-c a a" . #'dired-annotator-show-note)
                  ("'" . #'dired-annotator-show-note)))
  #+end_src

  A more complex example configuration using ~all-the-icons~ ([[https://github.com/domtronn/all-the-icons.el][repo]]), ~posframe~ ([[https://github.com/tumashu/posframe][repo]]), ~dired-narrow~ ([[https://github.com/Fuco1/dired-hacks#dired-narrow][repo]]) and ~org-ql~ ([[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql][repo]]):
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package dired-annotator
      :after (posframe all-the-icons org-ql dired-narrow)
      :load-path "~/repo/emacs-dired-annotator"
      :custom ((dired-annotator-note-icon (all-the-icons-faicon "sticky-note"))
               (dired-annotator-annotations-folder (expand-file-name "~/documents/annotations"))
               (dired-annotator-note-popup-hook #'dired-annotator--posframe-note-popup)
               (dired-annotator-note-fill-column 54) ;; a bit smaller than the popup window
               (dired-annotator-note-popup-remove-hook '(dired-annotator-register-buffer-cleanup
                                                         dired-annotator--remove-all-posframes)))
      :hook (dired-mode . dired-annotator-check-dir-local-show)
      :init
      (defconst dired-annotator-note-popup-width 56 "width of the note that pops up")
      (defconst dired-annotator-note-popup-height 40 "max height of the note that pops up")

      (defun dired-annotator--remove-all-posframes ()
        "remove all posframes"
        (unless (eq 'dired-annotator-show-note (lookup-key dired-mode-map (this-single-command-keys)))
          (setq dired-annotator--note-should-not-popup nil))
        (ignore-errors
          (posframe-hide-all)))

      (defun dired-annotator--posframe-note-popup (position annotation-file)
        (setq dired-annotator--note-should-not-popup t)
        (let ((note-buffer (find-file-noselect annotation-file)))
          (with-current-buffer note-buffer
            ;; make sure that regardless of org startup visibility, the buffer is fully visible
            (org-show-all))
          (posframe-show note-buffer :position position :lines-truncate t
                         :width dired-annotator-note-popup-width
                         :border-color "plum4" :border-width 2 :left-fringe 3 :right-fringe 3 )))

      :bind (:map dired-mode-map
                  ("C-c a r" . #'dired-annotator-reload-annotation-info)
                  ("C-c a d" . #'dired-annotator-dired-on-annotation-folder)
                  ("C-c a s" . #'dired-annotator-show-icons)
                  ("C-c a h" . #'dired-annotator-hide-icons)
                  ("C-c a k" . #'dired-annotator-delete-note)
                  ("C-c a o" . #'dired-annotator-edit-note)
                  ("C-c a e" . #'dired-annotator-edit-note)
                  ("C-c a a" . #'dired-annotator-show-note)
                  ("C-c a /" . #'dired-annotator-narrow-on-tag)
                  ("'" . #'dired-annotator-show-note)))
  #+end_src

  Feel free to use different keybindings and customizations (see ~M-x customize-group~ for ~dired-annotator~).

  To automatically show the notes icons in a dired folder, add the following to your ~.dir-locals.el~ in that folder:
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ((dired-mode . ((dired-annotator-show . t))))
  #+end_src
  and configure to run ~dired-annotator-check-dir-local-show~ when entering dired-mode (see hook configuration).

  Make sure to have required packages installed. Currently these are:
  - ~simple~ (built in)
  - ~uuid~ ([[https://github.com/nicferrier/emacs-uuid][repo]])
  - ~dired~ (built in)
  - ~dash~ ([[https://github.com/magnars/dash.el][repo]])
