#+title: dired-annotator

Keep notes to files in dired.

* General ideas

  This package will either use hashes or absolute file names of files to associate org notes with regular files. Whereas hashes will enable
  to identify files that may have been moved but did not change, the absolute file name will identify files that changed but did not move.

  When add a note to a file the identification method (hash or absolute file name) is selected. Currently there is no way to change this
  easily afterwards.

  All notes are kept as org files within a single folder.

  It is integrated with dired. Files that have associated note files will be annotated in dired (e.g. with a document symbol). This can be
  switched on and off. The note can be previewed with a posframe opening the note.

  Since getting the hash of large folders takes some time, default is that nothing is displayed. Switching it on, all
  file hashes are computed and each file is checked whether a note is available for that file. Those files with associated note files will
  be marked with the configured icon.

  It also is integrated with dired-subtree. When unfolding trees while notes should be displayed, all additional files displayed will be
  checked. Folding will then remove those icons alongside the subtree.

* Installation

  Since this currently is no package available on gnu, non-gnu nor melpa, clone the repository
  #+begin_src sh
    git clone https://github.com/gunther-bachmann/emacs-dired-annotator
  #+end_src

  and add this to your init file. Please adjust the load-path to the folder into which the project was cloned.
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package dired-annotator
      :load-path "~/repo/emacs-dired-annotator"
      :bind (:map dired-mode-map
                  ("C-c a s" . #'dired-annotator-show-icons)
                  ("C-c a h" . #'dired-annotator-hide-icons)
                  ("C-c a k" . #'dired-annotator-delete-note)
                  ("C-c a o" . #'dired-annotator-edit-note)
                  ("C-c a e" . #'dired-annotator-edit-note)
                  ("C-c a a" . #'dired-annotator-show-note)
                  ("'" . #'dired-annotator-show-note)))
  #+end_src

  A more complex example configuration using ~all-the-icons~ ([[https://github.com/domtronn/all-the-icons.el][repo]]) and ~posframe~ ([[https://github.com/tumashu/posframe][repo]]):
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package dired-annotator
      :after (posframe all-the-icons)
      :load-path "~/repo/emacs-dired-annotator"
      :custom ((dired-annotator-note-icon (all-the-icons-faicon "sticky-note"))
               (dired-annotator-annotations-folder (expand-file-name "~/documents/annotations"))
               (dired-annotator-note-popup-hook #'dired-annotator--posframe-note-popup)
               (dired-annotator-note-popup-remove-hook #'dired-annotator--remove-all-posframes))
      :init
      (defun dired-annotator--remove-all-posframes ()
        "remove all posframes"
        (unless (eq 'dired-annotator-show-note (lookup-key dired-mode-map (this-single-command-keys)))
          (setq dired-annotator--note-should-not-popup nil))
        (ignore-errors
          (posframe-hide-all)))

      (defun dired-annotator--posframe-note-popup (position annotation-file)
        (setq dired-annotator--note-should-not-popup t) ;; make sure next key pressed will not open note (not even in case of ')
        (posframe-show (find-file-noselect annotation-file) :position position :lines-truncate t
                       :width dired-annotator-note-popup-width :height dired-annotator-note-popup-height
                       :border-color "plum4" :border-width 2 :left-fringe 3 :right-fringe 3 ))

      :bind (:map dired-mode-map
                  ("C-c a s" . #'dired-annotator-show-icons)
                  ("C-c a h" . #'dired-annotator-hide-icons)
                  ("C-c a k" . #'dired-annotator-delete-note)
                  ("C-c a o" . #'dired-annotator-edit-note)
                  ("C-c a e" . #'dired-annotator-edit-note)
                  ("C-c a a" . #'dired-annotator-show-note)
                  ("'" . #'dired-annotator-show-note)))
  #+end_src

  Feel free to use different keybindings and customizations (see ~M-x customize-group~ for ~dired-annotator~).

  Make sure to have required packages installed. Currently these are:
  - ~simple~ (built in)
  - ~uuid~ ([[https://github.com/nicferrier/emacs-uuid][repo]])
  - ~dired~ (built in)
  - ~dash~ ([[https://github.com/magnars/dash.el][repo]])
